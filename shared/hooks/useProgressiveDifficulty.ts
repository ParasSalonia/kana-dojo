 * Smart progressive difficulty system for pick games.

 * - After M consecutive wrong answers, removes 1 option (down to 3)
 * - Tracks performance to adaptively adjust difficulty
 *
 * @example
 * const { optionCount, recordCorrect, recordWrong, difficultyLevel } = useProgressiveDifficulty();
 * // optionCount starts at 3
 * // After 3 correct answers: optionCount becomes 4
 * // After 6 correct answers: optionCount becomes 5
 * // After 9 correct answers: optionCount becomes 6 (max)
